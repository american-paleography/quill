1. set up the build process (e.g., with netbeans)
2. grab the (non-bundled) mongo driver. It was at https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/2.11.2/ (this is out of date, unsure about severity)
3. set up mongo (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-amazon/)
